# web-scraping (the Google Play Store)

Gathered and analyzed detailed information on apps in the Google Play Store in order to provide insights on app features and the 
current state of the Android app market.

We collected descriptive information on over 3,100 apps across 11 different categories in the Google App Store. We focused on 
the following 11 categories: Business, Food & Drink, Books & Reference, Travel & Local, Health & Fitness, News & Magazines, 
Education, Social, Finance, Medical, and Entertainment.

Used Selenium to scrape information about each of these apps for our analysis. We scraped app title, category, developer name, 
whether an app contains ads, rating, number of reviews, app size, number of installs, and price.
